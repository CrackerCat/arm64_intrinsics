# Arm64Intrinsics for Binja

Only like, five of them.

## Build

Makefile provided for `nmake` with vs2019. It should be pretty easy to port to
other platforms.

Clone this repo adjacent to `binaryninja-api`, and build `binaryninja-api`.

```
> ls

04/21/2020  06:48 PM    <DIR>          binaryninja-api
04/22/2020  11:36 PM    <DIR>          arm64_intrinsics

> cd arm64_intrinsics
> nmake
```

## Install

`nmake install`

## TODO

- Figure out how keep the dst register in `dst = msr(x0)` from being removed
  as a dead store.
- Add before/after photos
- Add more intrinsics

## Notes

- `src/msr.h` is autogenerated from from `aarch64.json`.

## Thanks

@NeatMonster for `aarch64.json` from AMIE.
