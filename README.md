# Arm64Intrinsics for Binja

Only like, five of them.

## Build

Makefile provided for `nmake` with vs2019. It should be pretty easy to port to
other platforms.

Clone this repo adjacent to `binaryninja-api`, and build `binaryninja-api`.

```
> ls

04/21/2020  06:48 PM    <DIR>          binaryninja-api
04/22/2020  11:36 PM    <DIR>          arm64_intrinsics

> cd arm64_intrinsics
> nmake
```

The makefile assumes Binja is installed in `%LOCALAPPDATA`. If it's installed
elsewhere (e.g. `C:\Program Files`...) update `BINJAPATH`.

## Install

`nmake install`

`nmake uninstall`

## Notes

- `src/msr.h` is autogenerated from from `aarch64.json` using `msr.py`.

## Thanks

@NeatMonster for `aarch64.json` from AMIE.
